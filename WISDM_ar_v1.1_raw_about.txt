Associated tasks: classification
Number of examples: 1,098,207
Number of attributes: 6

	Walking(0) -> 424,400 -> 38.6%,
	Jogging(1) -> 342,177 -> 31.2%,
}

raw.txt follows this format:
[user],[activity],[timestamp],[x-acceleration],[y-accel],[z-accel];

This line is a representative example:
33,1,49105962326000,-0.6946377,12.680544,0.50395286;

Sampling rate: 
20Hz (1 sample every 50ms)

Fields:
*user
	nominal, 1..36

*activity
	nominal, {
		Walking
		Jogging
		Sitting
		Standing
		Upstairs
		Downstairs }

*timestamp
	numeric, generally the phone's uptime in nanoseconds
		(In future datasets this will be miliseconds
		since unix epoch.)

*x-acceleration
	numeric, floating-point values between -20 .. 20
		The acceleration in the x direction as measured
		by the android phone's accelerometer. 
		A value of 10 = 1g = 9.81 m/s^2, and
		0 = no acceleration.
		The acceleration recorded includes gravitational
		acceleration toward the center of the Earth, so
		that when the phone is at rest on a flat surface
		the vertical axis will register +-10. 

*y-accel
	numeric, see x-acceleration

*z-accel
        numeric, see x-acceleration
